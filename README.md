# sdr_fm_bandscan
Simple bash script to do a FM bandscan using rtl_fm and redsea to decode RDS data, although I tried to make it flexible so you could use other FM or RDS programs.

You need to have the [rtl-sdr](https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/wiki) package for your distribution installed and working, and you'll likely have to compile and install [redsea](https://github.com/windytan/redsea) yourself (although it is in the AUR).
